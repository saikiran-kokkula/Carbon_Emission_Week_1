This project demonstrates how to import, inspect, and clean a raw dataset using Python. It covers essential data cleaning techniques using **Pandas**, and prepares the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
In Week 1 , i have three files, named climate change download, which is a dataset for the project, then data preparation, which consist the code to clean the dataset
which is known as data preprocessing and then data cleaned, which is a file that is generated as a result of the data preprocessing.

In Week2, the process is to plot the heatmaps and other visualization processes and techniques, which are in the file named data exploration.
The code performs data exploration and visualization on COâ‚‚ emissions and related factors using a cleaned dataset.
